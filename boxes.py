boxes.py

A partial implementation of the theory of packing boxes (for laying out
objects in two dimensions, although it could easily be extended to 3D)
from GTK+. This framework can be used to layout any NodePath or
DirectGui object.

Theory Of Packing Boxes
-----------------------

From GTK+. Boxes are invisible GUI widgets into which you pack other
widgets to achieve a desired layout. In a horizontal box (hbox) objects
are packed from left to right or right to left. In a vertical box (vbox)
objects are packed from top to bottom or bottom to top. You can pack
objects in both directions in the same box at the same time by using the
two different pack methods. Options control whether objects are packed
as tightly possible, or whether the objects are spread out to fill the
amount of space alloted to the box, etc.

Finally, a table is a type of box that manages a number of cells in rows
and columns. Objects are packed into the cells. A single object can
occupy multiple cells. When packing an object, you specify the range of
cells it will occupy by specifying left, right, bottom, and top cells.

What's implemented so far:

* hboxes with packing from left to right.
* vboxes with packing from top to bottom.
* You can pack boxes into boxes in any combination. Except that you
  cannot pack a box into itself.

Todo:

* Support packing in both directions.
* Option to pack objects tightly or space them out to fill a given
  width.
* Vertical alignment option for hboxes and horizontal alignment option
  for vboxes.
* Table box class.
* Refactor. Box should extend NodePath rather than DirectFrame, and
  should emulate a Python container class.

# We want our layout containers to be able to contain DirectGUI
# objects as well as NodePaths. The problem: we rely on
# NodePath.getTightBounds(), which returns the bounds of the object
# relative to its parent node. But with DirectGUI objects,
# getTightBounds() just returns (Point3(0,0,0),Point3(0,0,0). So
# we would like to write a wrapper class for DirectGUI objects, but
# which class do we extend? We want a class that is able to extend
# any DirectGUI object. We need to use mixins!
#
# (A mixin is a class that derives from an interface or abstract class,
# so that at run time it may extend any concrete class that implements
# a particular interface. Since Python has no explicit support for
# either interfaces or abstract classes, a Python implementation of
# mixins is a bit more informal than one in Java or C.)

def mixin(pyClass, mixInClass):
    """Append mixInClass to the front of the inheritance path of
    pyClass. This alters the behaviour of pyClass at runtime.
       
    This little function implements mixins in Python by adding a
    new class into the inheritance path of a class at runtime. Because
    mixInClass is added to the front of the inheritance path, methods in
    mixInClass will override methods in any other class that pyClass
    derives from (but they will not override methods in pyClass itself,
    although you could also implement mixins like that if you wanted).

    method that returns four floats (l,r,b,t), the bounds of the object
    in the objects own coordinate space. All the DirectGUI widgets
    implement this interface.
   
    Since getTightBounds() is useless as is (it always returns a bunch
    of zeros), it should not cause any problem to override its behaviour
    at the class level at runtime. (Surely no one could be making use of
    an apparently useless method?)
